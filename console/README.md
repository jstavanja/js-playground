# Console printing

This folder contains a Vite vanilla TypeScript application, which loads
a few files, that deal with different console debugging principles.

## Running the project

In the current directory, run:

```bash
# Either
npm install
# Or
yarn
```

Then, you can run the app in live reload mode using the command:

```bash
# Either
npm run dev
# Or
yarn dev
```

Go to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), to view the webpage with the loaded TypeScript code.
